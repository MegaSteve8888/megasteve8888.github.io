# Zachary Pham's Portfolio

My name is Zachary Pham, and I'm a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) that is majoring in Computer Science. I also have a minor in communication studies, as I hope to be a director for a game, or potentially an indie game dev!

### CPSC 120

- **Lab 7, Part 1**: Parking Rules
    For this lab's only part, we were instructed to create a program that determined whether we can park on a street, by taking the day of the week, the hour we intend to park, the street we intend to park on, and in the case of Date street, the minutes within the hour we parked on. I liked this lab because the goal here was easy to understand, but complex to program organization-wise; several relational and logical operators were required, so it was easy to get scrambled and cause a syntax error. This lab focused on the usage of if-else statements, along with relational operators.

    When me and my partner got to Date Street, both of us didn't know how exactly to program a complex set of instructions, and by that time we had to leave the lab for the day. When I got home, I decided to try and interpret the problem through the use of comments, before trying to simplify the problem within another coding program: Scratch. Through this, I knew what exactly what I wanted to program, and helped wrap up the program while also fixing some logic errors. In a way, I strongly demonstrated using the Design Flowchart, where I dissected a programming problem, developed a plan to solve the problem, identify the appropriate constructs, write code, and test & debug logical errors.
- **Lab 8, Part 1**: Olympic Judge Average
    This lab requested for us to create a program that takes at least three inputted judge scores, converts the string into a floating point, and then calculates the average score, eliminating impartial scores. This lab focused on the usage of arithmetic operators, for loops, and was likely the first lab I was in to utilize *.push_back* to add new elements on a vector. My favorite part of this lab was how smoothly it went, and how I cooperated with my teammates.

    This was one of my more cooperative experiences in lab together, even if we weren't able to finish the lab in its entirety. Both of us had equal knowledge in what we had to program, and when one of us didn't know what to do, someone else would fill in with us. Compared to other labs, especially ones after this; I felt like the rest of the labs I was in was mostly me working, with my teammates often being on the side, even if I encourage them to program or at least try and learn what constructs they needed to program.

    I also liked the second part, where we coded in a functioning pattern. However, I wouldn't say it's my top three favorites for two reasons: It wasn't as collaborative, and there was an error in the instructions that told me to input a number higher than what is actually required.
- **Lab 12, Part 1 & 2**: Making Our First Animation & Beautiful Noise
    Lab 12 focused on the usage of image generation through use of GraphicsMagick, a program that allowed for the printing of images. The first part involved combining three channels, or *.gif* files, into a single beautiful animated gradient. For the second part, we combined this with our knowledge in pseudo-random number generators in order to generate a background of randomly colored pixels behind yellow text. I liked this lab,

    Unlike Lab 7, Part 1, this one did not involve me going onto Scratch to translate the code into something simpler. Instead, it was mostly because programming it was easier than I expected once I asked for help. I was directed to another program that had functions that were needed to code in Part 1 of the lab. And as it turns out, most of the code within Part 1 was also needed for Part 2. For Part 2, I was at first frustrated by the part revolving around the use of the *Next()* function, but then I realized that it was a class method. This Lab was a culmination for all the other labs I've done. Even if things didn't go smoothly, I really liked programming for CPSC 120, relaxing as I type away and learn new concepts that could help with my future plans.
